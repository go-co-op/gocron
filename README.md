gocron is a job scheduling package which lets you run Go functions at pre-determined intervals.

## Quick Start

```
go get github.com/go-co-op/gocron/v2
```

```golang
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"

	"github.com/go-co-op/gocron/v2"
)

func main() {
	// create a scheduler
	s, err := gocron.NewScheduler()
	if err != nil {
		// handle error
	}

	// add a job to the scheduler
	j, err := s.NewJob(
		gocron.DurationJob(
			10*time.Second,
		),
		gocron.NewTask(
			func(a string, b int) {
				// do things
			},
			"hello",
			1,
		),
	)
	if err != nil {
		// handle error
	}
	// each job has a unique id
	fmt.Println(j.ID())

	// start the scheduler
	s.Start()

	// when you're done, shut it down
	err = s.Shutdown()
	if err != nil {
		// handle error
	}
}
```

## Concepts

- **Job**: The job encapsulates a "task", which is made up of a go function and any function parameters. The Job then
  provides the scheduler with the time the job should next be scheduled to run.
- **Scheduler**: The scheduler keeps track of all the jobs and sends each job to the executor when
  it is ready to be run.
- **Executor**: The executor calls the job's task and manages the complexities of different job
  execution timing requirements (e.g. singletons that shouldn't overrun each other, limiting the max number of jobs running)


## Features

### Job types
Jobs can be run at various intervals.
- [**Duration**](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-co-op/gocron/v2#DurationJob):
Jobs can be run at a fixed `time.Duration`.
- [**Random duration**](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-co-op/gocron/v2#DurationRandomJob):
Jobs can be run at a random `time.Duration` between a min and max.
- [**Cron**](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-co-op/gocron/v2#CronJob):
Jobs can be run using a crontab.
- [**Daily**](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-co-op/gocron/v2#DailyJob):
Jobs can be run every x days at specific times.
- [**Weekly**](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-co-op/gocron/v2#WeeklyJob):
Jobs can be run every x weeks on specific days of the week and at specific times.
- [**Monthly**](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-co-op/gocron/v2#MonthlyJob):
Jobs can be run every x months on specific days of the month and at specific times.
- [**One time**](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-co-op/gocron/v2#OneTimeJob):
Jobs can be run once at a specific time. These are non-recurring jobs.

### Concurrency Limits
Jobs can be limited individually or across the entire scheduler.
- [**Per job limiting with singleton mode**](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-co-op/gocron/v2#WithSingletonMode):
Jobs can be limited to a single concurrent execution that either reschedules (skips overlapping executions)
or queues (waits for the previous execution to finish).
- [**Per scheduler limiting with limit mode**](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-co-op/gocron/v2#WithLimitConcurrentJobs):
Jobs can be limited to a certain number of concurrent executions across the entire scheduler
using either reschedule (skip when the limit is met) or queue (jobs are added to a queue to
wait for the limit to be available).
- **Note:** A scheduler limit and a job limit can both be enabled.

### Distributed instances of gocron
Multiple instances of gocron can be run.
- [**Elector**](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-co-op/gocron/v2#WithDistributedElector):
An elector can be used to elect a single instance of gocron to run as the primary with the
other instances checking to see if a new leader needs to be elected.
- Implementations: [go-co-op electors](https://github.com/go-co-op?q=-elector&type=all&language=&sort=)
- [**Locker**](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-co-op/gocron/v2#WithDistributedLocker):
A locker can be used to lock each run of a job to a single instance of gocron.
- Implementations: [go-co-op lockers](https://github.com/go-co-op?q=-lock&type=all&language=&sort=)

### Events
Job events can trigger actions.
- [**Listeners**](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-co-op/gocron/v2#WithEventListeners):
Can be added to a job, with [event listeners](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-co-op/gocron/v2#EventListener),
or all jobs across the
[scheduler](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-co-op/gocron/v2#WithGlobalJobOptions)
to listen for job events and trigger actions.

### Options
Many job and scheduler options are available.
- [**Job options**](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-co-op/gocron/v2#JobOption):
Job options can be set when creating a job using `NewJob`.
- [**Global job options**](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-co-op/gocron/v2#WithGlobalJobOptions):
Global job options can be set when creating a scheduler using `NewScheduler`
and the `WithGlobalJobOptions` option.
- [**Scheduler options**](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-co-op/gocron/v2#SchedulerOption):
Scheduler options can be set when creating a scheduler using `NewScheduler`.

### Logging
Logs can be enabled.
- [Logger](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-co-op/gocron/v2#Logger):
The Logger interface can be implemented with your desired logging library.
The provided NewLogger uses the standard library's log package.

### Testing
The gocron library is set up to enable testing.
- Mocks are provided in [the mock package](mocks) using [gomock](https://github.com/uber-go/mock).
- Time can be mocked by passing in a [FakeClock](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/jonboulle/clockwork#FakeClock)
to [WithClock](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-co-op/gocron/v2#WithClock) -
see the [example on WithClock](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-co-op/gocron/v2#example-WithClock).
